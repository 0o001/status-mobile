## Research resources
Configuration is based off multiple projects -

https://github.com/DavidVujic/clojurescript-amplified

and it is also making use of React Native Web which is the needed ingredient to make it work with Status Mobile project 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-react-native-web

## Using it for development
if running in a new project or new branch you will probably have to install dependencies first too (make shell -> yarn )

Then: Open two terminal shells -
make storybook-clojure
make storybook-dev
